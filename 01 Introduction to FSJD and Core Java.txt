		- Duration of seq flow: 1+ years
		
	  2. In Parallel 3 courses per day 
		- For college completed students
		- and JOB seekers
		- per day 3 courses
		- Duration of paralle flow : 6+ months
		
       ========================= Parallel flow ==============================================  
	Level #1:   
		[Core Java] +  [Oracle]  +  [HTML, CSS, JS, BS]	       
		
	Level #2:   
		[Adv Java]  +  [DevOps tools]  + [AWS Basics]     	-> JOB as Fresher

	Level #3:   
		[Spring Basics, Spring Boot, Microservices] + [React]   -> JOB as Experienced
       =======================================================================================
	 	
05. Placement Assistance?
	- For FSJD course, Naresh IT is providing 
	  placement assistance for FREE

06. Exam for Placement Assistance?
	- To get eligiblility for free Placement Assistance
	  only after clearing screening test 

07. Placement exam syllabus and exam pattern?
     1. Example Syllabus 
	   1. Core Java
	   2. Oracle
	   3. HTML, CSS, JS, BS
	   4. Adv Java
	   5. Spring Basics module
     2. Exam pattern
	   1. Multiple choice questions
	   2. Scenario based questions

08. What is the Full Stack Java Development?
	- It is a one course using which
	  we can development one complete project
	  end-to-end i.e, 
		1. Frond-end UI screens to
		2. Back end programming and
		3. Data base
		
	- Ex: Amazon, irctc, phonepe, bank applications
	      etc... kind of applications we can develop
	      by using FSJ
		
09. Who is a Full stack Java Developer?
	 - A developer who can develop complete project
	   both 'front-end and back-end' by using Java lanaguge
	   and its frameworks is called FSJ Developer
	   
10. Project Architecture?
	- Every project has two sides 
		1. front-end and 
		2. back-end
	
	- A front-end is a screen where end-users interact with a website
		- The HTML pages(UI Screens) which are executed 
		  in Client System to display forms and reports 
		  for reading input and displaying output
		  are all together is called front-end
		  
		  -> in short cut we can say on a web site screen
		     what you see is called fron-end
		      For example: Amazon website home page 
		      is called front-end
	      
	- The programs and a data base those are executed
	  backside of the frontend screens in server computer
	  is called back-end
		- The backend programs are developed by using 
		  a programming langauge.
			For example: Java, Python, .NET, etc...
		
		- A Database is a store media where we can
		  store data of a person or a product permanantly
			For example: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, etc...
				     are the Databases
	
	- Hence we can say every project has 3 parts
		1. UI (User Interface)
		2. Programming
		3. Data base
		
	- Diagram
	
10. Diff applications we can develop by using Java?
	1. Desktop applications
	2. Web applications
	3. Enterprise applications
	4. Distributed applications
	5. Mobile applications
	6. Gaming applications
	7. Big data applications
	8. Testing applications
	9. DS, ML, DL, AI (Java 25v)
